Task 1: Cloning and Forking

1. Cloning a Repository:

  - Choose a public GitHub repository of interest (e.g., a project related to your field of study).

  - Clone the repository to your local machine.

  - Explore the repository's structure, files, and history.



2. Forking a Repository:

  - Fork the same repository you cloned in Task 1 to your GitHub account.

  - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.



Task 2: Managing Branches

3. Creating and Switching Branches:

  - In your local repository, create a new branch (e.g., `feature-update`).

  - Switch to the newly created branch.



4. Making Changes and Committing:

  - Make changes to a file or add a new file.

  - Commit the changes to the branch.



5. Merging Changes:

  - Switch back to the main branch.

  - Merge the changes from the `feature-update` branch into the main branch.



Task 3: Handling Conflicts

6. Creating Conflicts:

  - In your forked repository, make changes to the same file that you modified in Task 4.

  - Commit the changes.



7. Resolving Conflicts:

  - Create a new branch to resolve the conflict.

  - Resolve the conflict manually in the file.

  - Commit the changes and merge the branch back into `main`.



Task 4: GitHub Pages

8. Enabling GitHub Pages:

  - In your forked repository, create a simple HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).

  - Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to `main`.



9. Accessing the Published Page:

  - Visit the GitHub Pages URL for your repository and verify that the HTML file is accessible online.



Task 5: Open Source Exploration

10. Exploring Open Source Projects:

  - Search for an open-source project on GitHub related to your interests.

  - Explore the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines.



11. Opening an Issue:

  - Open a new issue in the chosen open-source project, suggesting an improvement, reporting a bug, or asking for clarification.



Submission:

- Push all changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

- Share the link to your forked repository and mention the open-source project you explored with the instructor or submit it as per the class instructions.



Additional Tips:

- Document your process, commands used, and any challenges faced in a text file or in the README of your repository.

- If you encounter issues, refer to the GitHub documentation or seek assistance from peers or the instructor.

Challenges of Cloning a Repository:

Finding the Right Repository: Identifying a suitable public repository on GitHub related to your interests or field of study might take some time and research.
Cloning Process: Depending on the size of the repository and your internet connection speed, cloning the repository to your local machine might take a while. You may encounter issues such as slow download speeds or interruptions during the cloning process.
Repository Structure Understanding: Understanding the structure of the cloned repository, especially if it's a large project with many files and directories, can be challenging. You may need to spend some time navigating through the files to get a clear understanding of the project's layout.
Challenges of Forking a Repository:

Choosing the Repository to Fork: Selecting a repository to fork that aligns with your interests and goals can be challenging, especially if you're not sure what you're looking for.
Forking Permissions: If the repository owner has restricted forking permissions, you may encounter difficulties forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
Keeping Fork Synced: After forking a repository, keeping your fork up-to-date with the original repository can be challenging, especially if there are frequent changes being made to the original repository. You'll need to learn about syncing forks to ensure you have the latest changes.
Understanding Forked Repository Ownership: Understanding the relationship between the original repository and your fork can be confusing for beginners. It's important to grasp concepts such as upstream repositories and remote tracking branches.
Contributing Back to Original Repository: If your intention is to contribute to the original repository, understanding the process of making pull requests and contributing changes back to the original project can be challenging, especially if you're new to open-source contribution workflows.
These challenges are common for beginners learning how to work with Git and GitHub, but overcoming them will provide valuable experience and skills in version control and collaborative development
